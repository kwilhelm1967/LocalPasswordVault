                    LOCAL PASSWORD VAULT - GETTING STARTED
                              Family Plan Guide
================================================================================

This guide is for the family organizer setting up Local Password Vault for 
the household. Share this guide with family members or walk them through it.

================================================================================
                    STEP 1: DISTRIBUTE LICENSE KEYS
================================================================================

Your Family Plan includes 5 unique license keys. Assign one to each person:

Key 1 (FMLY-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX) → ________________________
Key 2 (FMLY-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX) → ________________________
Key 3 (FMLY-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX) → ________________________
Key 4 (FMLY-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX) → ________________________
Key 5 (FMLY-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX) → ________________________

Write down who has which key! Each person uses ONLY their assigned key.

================================================================================
                    STEP 2: SHARE THE INSTALLER
================================================================================

Option A - Share the installer file directly:
- Copy LocalPasswordVault-Setup.exe to a USB drive
- Share via home network
- AirDrop (Mac)

Option B - Each person downloads:
- Visit: https://LocalPasswordVault.com
- Download the version for their operating system

================================================================================
                    STEP 3: EACH FAMILY MEMBER SETS UP
================================================================================

Each person follows these steps on THEIR device:

Installation:
1. Run the installer
2. Follow prompts to install
3. Launch Local Password Vault

Activation:
1. Enter THEIR license key (assigned to them)
2. Click "Activate License"

Master Password:
1. Create a strong, unique master password
2. This is PRIVATE - don't share with other family members
3. WRITE IT DOWN - it cannot be recovered

⚠️  Each person should have their OWN master password!

================================================================================
                    FOR PARENTS: HELPING CHILDREN SET UP
================================================================================

For younger children:
1. Help them install and activate
2. Help them create a master password
3. Consider writing down their master password in YOUR secure location
4. Explain that this is their private vault
5. Show them how to add and find passwords

For teenagers:
1. Let them set up independently if capable
2. Explain the importance of the master password
3. Suggest they write it down somewhere safe
4. Trust their privacy - their vault is theirs

================================================================================
                    FAMILY SETUP TIPS
================================================================================

1. Set Up Together
   Schedule family time to set everyone up at once. Makes troubleshooting easier.

2. Choose a Backup Strategy
   Decide where each person will store their encrypted backups:
   - Family NAS
   - External hard drive
   - USB drives (labeled by person)

3. Establish Password Practices
   - Everyone uses the password generator
   - No reusing passwords
   - Regular backups (weekly suggested)

4. Don't Share Master Passwords
   Even in a family, keep master passwords private. If you need access to a 
   child's vault, help them unlock it - don't ask for their password.

================================================================================
                    WHAT'S NOT SHARED
================================================================================

Each family member's vault is 100% independent:

✗ Passwords are NOT synced between family members
✗ Vaults are NOT shared or visible to others
✗ Master passwords are NOT stored anywhere
✗ We have NO access to anyone's data

This is intentional for maximum security and privacy.

================================================================================
                    IF SOMEONE NEEDS SHARED PASSWORDS
================================================================================

Sometimes families need to share passwords (Netflix, WiFi, etc.):

Option 1: Each person stores shared passwords in their own vault
- Everyone adds the same passwords manually
- No sync means no single point of failure

Option 2: Designated "family passwords" manager
- One person maintains shared accounts
- Share credentials verbally when needed

================================================================================
                    TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

"Key Already in Use"
- Each key can only activate ONE device
- Check if that key was used on another device
- Contact support to reset if needed

"Wrong Key Type"
- Ensure you're using a FMLY-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX key
- Personal (PERS) keys won't work with Family licenses

"Forgot Master Password"
- Unfortunately cannot be recovered
- If they have a backup, restore from that
- Otherwise, must start fresh with new vault
