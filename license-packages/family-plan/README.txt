Key 2: [IN YOUR PURCHASE EMAIL] → Family Member 2
Key 3: [IN YOUR PURCHASE EMAIL] → Family Member 3
Key 4: [IN YOUR PURCHASE EMAIL] → Family Member 4

================================================================================
                              HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

1. Each family member installs Local Password Vault on their device
2. Each person activates with their OWN unique key
3. Each person creates their OWN master password
4. Each person has a completely PRIVATE vault

Vaults are NOT shared or synced. This is by design for maximum security.
Each family member's passwords are 100% private to them.

================================================================================
                              QUICK START
================================================================================

For the family organizer:
1. Distribute one license key to each family member
2. Share the installer file or download link
3. Each person follows their own setup (see GETTING_STARTED.txt)

For each family member:
1. Install Local Password Vault
2. Enter YOUR license key (not someone else's)
3. Create YOUR master password
4. Start storing YOUR passwords

================================================================================

                              IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

⚠️  Each person's master password CANNOT be recovered.
⚠️  Each person should create their own backups.
⚠️  Vaults are private - family members cannot see each other's passwords.
⚠️  Lost a key? Contact priority support.
