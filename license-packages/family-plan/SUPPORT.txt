                         🔧 COMMON FAMILY ISSUES
================================================================================

ISSUE: "License Key Already in Use"
-----------------------------------
Each key can only activate ONE device. Solutions:
1. Check if the key was used on another device in the family
2. If the old device is gone, contact support to reset the key
3. Make sure each family member uses THEIR assigned key

ISSUE: Family Member Forgot Master Password
-------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, master passwords cannot be recovered. Options:
1. If they have an encrypted backup, restore from that
2. Otherwise, they must create a new vault (losing old data)

Prevention tip: Parents might want to securely store children's master 
passwords in their own vault.

ISSUE: Child Needs Help But Parent Can't Access
-----------------------------------------------
Vaults are private by design. Options:
1. Have the child unlock while you watch
2. Help them verbally without seeing their password
3. For young children, consider storing their master password securely

ISSUE: Device Replacement
-------------------------
To move a license to a new device:
1. On OLD device: Settings > License > Deactivate
2. On NEW device: Enter the same license key
3. If old device is lost: Contact support to reset

ISSUE: Need More Than 5 Licenses
--------------------------------
Contact us for additional licenses or to discuss larger family needs.

                    💡 FAMILY-SPECIFIC TIPS
================================================================================

Setting Up Children
-------------------
- Help them choose a memorable master password
- Store their master password in YOUR vault (for emergencies)
- Explain the password generator
- Set up categories for their accounts
- Enable auto-lock for younger children

Shared Family Accounts
----------------------
Since vaults don't sync, for shared accounts (Netflix, WiFi, etc.):
- Each person can add the same accounts to their vault
- One person can be the "keeper" of shared accounts
- Share verbally rather than through the app

Backup Strategy
---------------
Set up family backup practices:
- Weekly backups for everyone
- Central storage location (family NAS, external drive)
- Label backups by person and date

Teaching Password Security
--------------------------
Use Local Password Vault to teach good habits:
- Use the generator, don't create passwords manually
- Never reuse passwords
- Keep the vault locked when away
- Regular backup routine
