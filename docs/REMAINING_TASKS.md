# Remaining Tasks & Fixes

**Status:** Most items completed. See `PRODUCT_OWNER.md` for current status.

**Last Updated:** December 25, 2024

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Family Plan Model Implementation ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Model:** Family Plan = 5 Separate Keys, Each for 1 Device (No Sharing)
- Family plan purchase generates 5 distinct license keys
- Each key can be activated on 1 device only
- Keys cannot be shared or reused on multiple devices
- Each key behaves like a personal license (single device binding)

**Implementation:**
- `backend/routes/webhooks.js` - Generates 5 keys with `max_devices: 1` each
- `backend/routes/lpv-licenses.js` - Enforces single device binding per key
- `docs/FAMILY_PLAN_MODEL.md` - Complete model documentation
- `docs/TESTING_FAMILY_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive testing guide

**Note:** This is the intended design. Family plan = 5 keys (one per family member), not 1 key for 5 devices.

## 🟡 IMPORTANT FIXES (Should Fix)

### 2. Update DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE (December 25, 2024)

**Action Completed:**
- ✅ Removed all outdated JWT sections and references
- ✅ Updated to reflect signed license file approach (HMAC-SHA256)
- ✅ Marked completed items (device management UI, bundle handling, error handling)
- ✅ Updated Quick Start section with correct file references
- ✅ Updated architecture notes to emphasize signed license files
- ✅ Removed JWT references from API endpoints, security considerations, and implementation notes

**Files Updated:**
- `docs/DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md` - Fully updated to reflect current signed license file architecture

---

### 3. Device Management Screen - Backend Integration (Optional)
**Location:** `src/components/DeviceManagementScreen.tsx`

**Current State:**
- Shows only local device (privacy-first approach)
- Comment says "in real implementation, this would come from backend"

---

## 🟢 NICE TO HAVE (Optional Enhancements)

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
**Missing:**
- Unit tests for license activation flows
- Integration tests for Stripe webhook handling
- E2E tests for trial signup → purchase flow
- Offline validation tests

**Files to Create:**
- `backend/__tests__/webhooks.test.js`
- `backend/__tests__/trial.test.js`
- `src/utils/__tests__/licenseService.test.ts`
- `src/utils/__tests__/licenseValidator.test.ts`

---

### 5. Error Logging & Monitoring
**Missing:**
- Structured error logging
- Error tracking service integration (optional)
- Webhook failure alerts

**Current:** Basic console.error logging

**Enhancement:** Add structured logging with error codes and context

---

### 6. License Revocation Handling
**Current State:**
- Backend can revoke licenses (`status = 'revoked'`)
- Frontend checks revocation on activation
- No proactive revocation check after activation

**Enhancement (Optional):**
- Periodic revocation check (breaks privacy-first model)
- Or: Keep current approach (check on next activation/transfer)

**Recommendation:** Keep current approach (privacy-first).

---

### 7. Transfer History ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Transfer count and last transfer date included in signed license files
- ✅ Transfer history displayed in License Status Dashboard
- ✅ Shows "X / 3" transfers with limit warning

---

## ✅ COMPLETED (No Action Needed)

1. ✅ Privacy-first license system with signed license files
2. ✅ Zero network calls after activation
3. ✅ Family plan device management UI
4. ✅ Bundle purchase handling
5. ✅ Enhanced error handling
6. ✅ License Status Dashboard
7. ✅ Instant trial key generation
8. ✅ Instant purchase key delivery
9. ✅ Email templates with OS-specific download buttons
10. ✅ All pricing links point to correct page
